**Cru - Front End Dev Challenge**

For this challenge, we are looking for you to create a simple rostering solution SPA for visualising the shifts of employees.
For example this could be used for a small business that works 24/7 to manage the shifts of it's employees to make sure everyone gets adequate days off and doesn't get shifts which are directly back-to-back (eg working on a night shift followed by a morning shift the next day)

We're providing you with three mock data JSON files:

 - Employees: The people who are being rostered
 - Shifts: These are the bits of work assigned to employees. If a shift is assigned to an employee, it will have its employee_id property set to an integer matching the id field on the employee.
 - Role: The type/label of the shift. Each shift will have a role_id which corresponds to a role.

The amount of time you spend on this exercise should be 1 hour of coding and we are looking to meet the following guidelines:

 - The app should use React as a base framework - any library choices beyond this are up to you.
 - The app should display the whole week of rostering information for the employees in the mock data set.
 - The roster must be represented in a visualisation of some form - we're looking for something that would aid end users in understanding the information they're being presented with.

If any of the requirements are unclear feel free to send through questions for clarification or make assumptions - we are not trying to test you on your knowledge of rostering.

When you're ready to share your solution with us, email a link to your recruiter or Cru Software contact.

On completion, if there are additional things you think you could have done better/did not have enough time to complete, feel free to compile a quick list and bring it to the technical interview to help remind yourself during the discussion.
